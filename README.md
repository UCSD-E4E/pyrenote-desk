# Pyrenote Desktop

## Setup

We are using `yarn` for this application! Please install `yarn` with `npm install -g yarn` ([tutorial](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-and-use-the-yarn-package-manager-for-node-js)).

Enter ``yarn && yarn dev` into the terminal, and the application should install all your dependencies and open up a new electron window!

## Development

This uses a package called [Nextron](https://blog.logrocket.com/building-app-next-js-electron/) to combine Electron and Next.js. All [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) code can be found in the `/renderer` directory. Additionally, all code is written in [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/).
